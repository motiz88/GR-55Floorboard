 JUST KEEP IN MIND THE RELENTLESS HOURS SPENT GETTING IT HERE,

        the associated clipBoard and replaces the current settings for that one effect only.

********** USEFUL INFORMATION *************
* 
* The Bulk Patch Editing function should be used with caution 
* as it can't be undone, and a Bulk Patch Backup is recommended before using it.
* 
* fixed patch write bug - stopped popup error dialog when there was no error. 

********* FIRST USE CONNECTION HINTS ************** 
 
a.) Connect the GR-55 via a USB cable, 
ensure the Roland GR-55 USB driver software is installed.

b.) In most cases the program should select GR-55 device and connect automaticaly, if not, then follow the next two steps.
Start the FloorBoard program, for the Menu select Preferences/Midi and select the GR55 midi device for midi input and output.

c.) Select the editor program "Connect" button, it should stay "on" if all connections are correct.

d.) Open the Patch-Tree side panel by clicking your mouse pointer on the 'yellow arrow', 
the Patch-Tree has items which will expand when you click on the [+] symbols.
 When the tree items expand, you will see the patch names appear as the editor requests this information from the GR-55.

e.) A single mouse pointer click on the Patch-Tree name will change the GR-55 to that selected patch only 
- sound played through the GR-55 will have the sound of that patch.
 
f.) A double click on the patch name will load the patch information from the GR-55 into the editor, 
all the patch settings will update the editor GUI.

g.) Any knob turning will change the sound of the effect being adjusted, 
when the desired sound is achieved, you can either save the patch to the GR-55 or save the patch to file on disk.

h.) To save the patch to the GR-55, select a location with a 'single-click' on the Patch-Tree,
then press the "write/sync" button. 

****************** If there is a problem 'connecting' ensure the GR-55 UNIT ID is set to "10" (factory default) 
* and the midi channel is set to "10".*************************************************************************

GR-55FloorBoard/GT-FxFloorBoard/ME-Edit: 
NOTE: THIS IS AN UNPAID PROJECT, SO FAR INVESTING OVER 7000 HOURS OF MY TIME OVER 5 YEARS, 
I WILL NOT ACCEPT LIABILITY FOR ANY DATA LOSS, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK CORRECTLY, 
BUT SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE INCORRECT. 

files can be saved/loaded as syx or mid (SMF) or g5l (Librarian) formats.
the GR-55FloorBoard will also open GT10 *.gxg & *.mid files, and translate VG-99 patch files (future option).

layout increased, which may be a problem for low screen resolutions. (i use 1280 X 800 minimum)

This project is a continuing session of evolution.........

patch tree to the left side should give patch change on single click and (when 'connected' button active),
 double click should request patch transfer.
opening each bank node should request patch names (while 'connected').

patch rename by doubleclicking name display panel.
