GR-55FxFloorBoard PREVIEW version 20110304: 04 Mar 2011
*****************************************************
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DONATE, YOU MAY FREELY USE THIS SOFTWARE, 
 JUST KEEP IN MIND THE RELENTLESS HOURS SPENT GETTING IT HERE,
  I WOULD LOVE A BEER!!!. :-)
but then patches created by you for sharing with all would be nice too.
you can email patches and custom system settings saved files to the above address.
***********************************************************************************
 ********* LATEST FEATURES ADDED****************************************************
 *INITIAL UPLOAD FOR INSPECTION <<<< NOTE THAT THE EDITOR IS NOT YET FUNCTIONAL AND IS A PREVIEW ONLY 
 *DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY SAVED PATCH FILES GENERATED BY THE EDITOR AS THE FILE STRUCTURE IS NOT COMPLETE >>>>
  
 Here is an update on "where it's at"...

Most of the patch functions are now implemented, except for
Assigns - temporarily removed the Target controls to prevent program crashes, and assigns 7 & 8 are not right.

System setting are not yet implemented, so pressing the system button will initiate a system data request, but the reply data has been blocked to prevent 'bad things' from happening.

The File system is not yet 100% compatible with the *.g5l format, and files saved by the editor should not be distributed, there is a 5% gap missing in the middle which will only contain "init patch" data. There is some weird structure that Roland has done there where parts of the patch data have been transposed.
This also includes "Bulk Patch Backups" from the editor. I hope to have this resolved by the end of next week.

The EQ and NS effects L.E.D button on the floorboard are not indicating correctly, the actual effect stompbox is OK, just an indication "thing".

Preset patches are not displayed, because i can't find the memory address they reside in, and Roland have not yet supplied any specification documentation.

No Help file system yet, i am leaving that until last, so i don't have to backtrack an repeatedly redo stuff.

Patch Text Summary no yet implemented until the file structure is 100%



This project is a continuing session of evolution.........

patch tree to the left side should give patch change on single click and (when 'connected' button active),
 double click should request patch transfer.
opening each bank node should request patch names (while 'connected').

patch rename by doubleclicking name display panel.
